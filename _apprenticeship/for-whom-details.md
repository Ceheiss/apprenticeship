Our apprenticeship program aims at less experienced Software Developers, so we focus on **potential** over *professional experience* and **behaviour** over *achievements*. 

Maybe you feel like you are only churning through work without gaining more knowledge and confidence in what you are doing. Making advancements is so much harder if you don't have someone mentoring you - especially when you are only starting out in the tech world. 

If you are looking for a way to kickstart your career then join us, go through the program and become a Software Crafter working at HolidayCheck.

##### Things we would like to see in you

* You can solve problems in at least **one Programming Language**
* You want to **learn** and **improve** yourself constantly
* You are able to **self-organize**
* You want to **share** your **knowledge** in- and outside the office

##### Things we don't filter by

* **Degrees**: Degrees are a privilege that we don't base our decisions on
* **GitHub profile**: Not everyone has time & energy to program in their spare time
* **Technology**: We don't expect knowledge in specific tools or frameworks

##### Things you will do after you graduated

* join one of our cross-functional, self-organized product teams
* write quality code using Scala, JavaScript/TypeScript, Nix, ...
* hone your skills in regular coding katas
