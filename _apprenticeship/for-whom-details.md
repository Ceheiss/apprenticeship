When selecting candidates for our apprenticeship program we focus on **potential** over *professional experience* and **behaviour** over *achievements*. We will give you a platform to grow professionally and a safe space for learning. This is our investment in you. What we expect from you in return is:

* Confidence in at least **one Programming Language**
* **Apprentice attitude**: You want to learn and improve yourself
* **Dedication**: Continuously challenging yourself is demanding!
* **Self-Organized**: We will mentor you but **you** will be in the driver's seat
* **Be an amplifier**: share your learnings in- and outside of the office

If you feel like you can live up to these expectations then don't hesitate to get in contact with us. 

Send us your application to **apprenticeship@holidaycheck.com** - Please include some info on yourself and why you think you are a good fit for our program.

We are looking forward to hear from you!
