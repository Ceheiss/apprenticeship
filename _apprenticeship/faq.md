**Q: Will my salary be cut in any way?**

 Not at all. Salaries during and after the **Apprenticeship** will be calculated in the same way as any non-apprentice employee. 

**Q: Is anything about my contract special during the apprenticeship?**

No, it's a regular permanent employment contract, nothing special about it. 

**Q: I have more questions, how can I ask them?**
